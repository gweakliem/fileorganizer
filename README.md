# fileorganizer

I wanted to learn some Rust, and I have a terabyte drive full of old pictures that are super disorganized across many directories. My idea is to try to determine which of these pictures are duplicates and attempt to organize them.

Duplicate detection by 
* File Name
* SHA-256 hash
* EXIF Metadata
